    "# Final Project: Flight Price Prediction\n",

    "According to statistics from the Bureau of Transportation, over 853 million passengers traveled through U.S. airports in 2022. In 2020, there were 388 million passengers traveling and in 2021, there were 658 million passengers. The number of travelers has been steadily increasing year by year as the global aviation industry has expanded and demand for tourism has accelerated. However, not everyone in the world can afford to fly because of the high cost of air travel. We hope to give potential passengers and airlines an idea of the market demand and price of air travel. \n",

    "     Are we able to find the cheapest flight price given certain criteria for flights?"
